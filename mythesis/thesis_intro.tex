Quantum Chromodynamics is the SU(3) gauge field theory governing the strong force, dictating the dynamics of quarks and gluons. One can have two or three quark states, mesons and baryons, respectively, bound together by gluons. In continuum QCD, the regime in which the coupling constant of the theory is still small, perturbation theory can reliably be used. However, to probe the hadronic world ($\mu \leq 1 GeV$) , perturbation theory ceases to be a useful tool. By discretizing Minkowski spacetime into Euclidean spacetime, we can calculate the hadron spectrum and other quantities such as mattrix elements.
This non-perturbative approach is called Lattice QCD(henceforth LQCD), the only systematically improvable and regularization scheme independent method to probe the strong force. It is crucial to note that this formulation is \textbf{not} a model; LQCD preserves 
Hadronic states that do not fit into the traditional quark model have been coined XYZ states \todo{cite{xyz review article}} or exotics. Exotic hadrons are interesting for a host of reasons:
