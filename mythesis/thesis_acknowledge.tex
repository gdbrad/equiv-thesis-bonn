I would like to thank my advisor Prof.\ Dr.\ Stefan Krieg for giving me the opportunity to pursue my PhD in a beautiful topic and country. He provides endless guidance in both the research vocation and how to navigate the problems that arise when moving to a foreign country. His advice in both realms is always just a door-knock or phone call away and has made my adjustment to Germany, and the frustration-laden process of conducting research, all the more smoother.       

I also wish to thank Dr.\ Giovanni Pederiva for his tireless attention to detail with all things programming, the physics ``big picture'', and advice on how to manage my workflow in an efficient manner. His programming and HPC expertise have been a crucial factor in progressing this project forward. I am indebetted to his patience and suggestions at every step of the way. 

I would be remiss to not acknowledge the fruitful discussions with Dr.\ Evan Berkowitz; His insightful ``mini lectures'' have illuminated countless deep truths in physics and group theory that were previously unbeknownst to me.
