\section{Gauge Field Smearing}
In order to achieve overlap with states of interest in the continuum, namely the low-lying states, one must being with smearing of the quark fields via some smoothing function. A brief exposition of \textit{Jacobi smearing} will follow. 
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{\psi}_{a\alpha}(x) = \mathcal{S}_{ab}(x,y) \psi_{b\alpha}(y)
\end{equation}
Here, $x,y$ are lattice sites, $a,b$ are color indices, $\alpha$ a spin component. 

This construction is derived from the ``parent'' representation of a gauge-invariant, spatially symmetric operation, which serves as a means of improving the projection onto low-lying states in correlation functions:
\begin{align}
    \tilde{\Psi}(\vec{x},t) = \sum_{\vec{y}} L(\vec{x},\vec{y})\psi(\vec{y},t)
\end{align}
Define the jacobi smearing operator as 
\begin{align}
\nabla
\end{align}

\section{Distillation Smearing}
% \cite{peardon_novel_2009}
The information we need to extract is 
$$ V^{\dagger}M^{-1}V \rightarrow \tau $$ 
where $\tau$ is the perambulator matrix on a single time slice. 
$V(t)$ is a matrix with $4 \times N_v $  columns constructed from eigenvectors of the covariant 3d Laplace operator. It is important to note that $V(t)$ does not act on Dirac components. Thus, $V(t)$ is a block identity in Dirac space and each block contains the first $N_v$ eigenvectors $v_i(t)$. A given column $V^{(i,\alpha)}(t)$ has entries 
$$ V^{(i,\alpha)}(t)_{\vec{x},t',\beta} = v_i(t)_{\vec{x}} \delta_{tt'}\delta_{\alpha\beta}$$


Propagators transform with tensor product structure 
$$\text{Lattice} \otimes \text{Matrix(Nc)} \otimes \text{Matrix(Ns)} \otimes \text{Complex}$$
\textbf{check this and format with a figure from the TALK AT NRW FAIR }
We can work out these dimensions for ourselves; A distilled propagator stored on disk has dimensions 
$ 2 * 8 *2 *4 *4 *10 * 10 * 16$ 
with the dictionary 
$$\text{} \text{complex} * \text{snk} * \text{src} * N \times N_{\sigma} * \text{tslice}$$

At this point, we need to actually perform contractions to obtain the correlator 
$$C_M^{(2)}(t',t) = Tr[\Phi^B(t')\tau(t',t)\Phi^A(t)\tau(t,t')]$$ 
where 
$$\Phi^A_{\alpha\beta}(t) = V^{\dagger}(t) [\Gamma^A(t)]_{\alpha\beta} V(t) \equiv V^{\dagger}(t)\mathcal{D}^A(t)V(t)S^A_{\alpha\beta}$$ 
and 
$$\tau_{\alpha\beta}(t',t) = V^{\dagger}(t')M_{\alpha\beta}^{-1}(t',t)V(t)$$ 
is the perambulator, defined by the lattice representation of the Dirac operator, $M$.
