The first chapter explains the formulation of quarks and gluons on a Euclidean lattice. The second chapter introduces Monte Carlo methods and details the numerical algorithms to simulate lattice gauge fields. Chapter three explains the mathematical and numerical techniques needed to study quark fields and the computation of quark propagators. The fourth chapter is devoted to the physical observables constructed from lattice fields and explains how to measure them in simulations. The book is aimed at enabling graduate students who are new to the field to carry out explicitly the first steps and prepare them for research in lattice QCD.}

title = {Three Pion Scattering at Maximal Isospin from Lattice QCD at Physical Mass},
school = {Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-UniversitÃ¤t Bonn},
year = 2021,
month = jan,
note = {In this work the scattering of two pions in $I = 2$ and three pions in $I = 3$ is analyzed with lattice QCD. The process is computed on three Wilson clover twisted mass ensembles generated by the ETMC with total momentum up to $vec P^2 leq 4$ in all irreducible representations. One ensemble has been simulated at the physical pion mass.
The correlation functions are treated with methods to suppress thermal states and excited states. Energy extraction is performed with multiple different fit methods and a combination afterwards such that the systematic errors from fit range selection are taken into account.
The three-pion spectrum has been fitted using the RFT approach. We obtain $a_0 M_piup = 0.0481(86)$ for the two-pion scattering length at the physical pion mass. In the three-pion sector a constant and linear coefficient of the contact interaction has been extracted. The constant term agrees both with an existing analysis and leading order ChPT, the linear term has tension with the leading order ChPT prediction at high pion masses.},
