These are essential building blocks of computations of nucleon parton distribution functions (PDFs), generalized parton distribution functions (GPDs) and transverse momentum dependent distributions functions (TMDs). Lattice QCD computations of these quantities can provide additional input to assist with the global fits on experimental data for determining TMDs, GPDs and PDFs.},
